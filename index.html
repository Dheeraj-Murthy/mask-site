							The Chhau mask is a traditional cultural heritage of Purulia in
							the Indian state of West Bengal. The Chhau mask of Purulia is
							registered on the List of Geographical Indications. As the basic
							difference of Purulia Chhau the mask is unique and traditional. It
							is the mask which differentiates the Purulia Chhau from its other
							two significant branches: the Seraikella Chhau of Jharkhand and
							the Mayurbhanj Chhau of Odisha. The Jharkhand counterpart does
							involve masks but they are rather simpler, small and evocative,
							without any of the pompous vibrancy of the Purulia variants. It is
							the Purulia form only that uses large evocative masks along with
							elaborate costumes that intensify the energetic performance,
							despite the challenges to physicalization. The mask allows the
							artists to morph into the character therefore when an artists
							wears a particular mask, he or she “gets into character
							immediately, transforming into mellow Kartik, fierce Ravana, or
							Durga's ferocious lion.

							The tradition of making Chhau masks started during the rule of
							king Madan Mohan Singh Deo of Baghmundi. The Chhau mask is
							traditionally associated with the age-old dance forms in Purulia
							district. The tradition of mask-making was popularised by
							Buddeshwar, who is venerated as the first mask maker of Charida.
							In Charida, there is also a statue of Buddeshwar. He is said to
							have created the first male and female masks, known as Kirat and
							Kiratni, representing forms of Shiva and Parvati. This was a
							turning point in the history of mask-making.
							<br />
							<hr class="blank" />
							The Purulia Chhau mask received the GI tag in 2018. This has been
							a welcome step: the artists have become more aware of their
							intellectual property rights. Besides being used for performances,
							some of the masks are sold as keepsakes and souvenirs particularly
							to the tourists.

							The masks are of various types used for particular dance
							renditions. They are classified into the babu, bir, bhoot, animal,
							birds, and nari masks. The babu category includes masks for
							chiefly male gods like Narayana, Ganesha, Kartik, Krishna, Shiva,
							etc. The bir or the hero masks would include those worn by artists
							who play the demons like Ravana and Mahishasura. Tiger, buffalo,
							monkey heroes like Bali and Sugriva from the epic Ramayana fall
							under the category of animal masks. Durga, Parvati, Saraswati and
							incarnations of the Goddess are categorised under the nari or
							women masks, while bird masks are for Jatayu, peacock, swan, etc.
							<br />
							<hr class="blank" />
							The masks are made “according to his or her facial measurements by
							their trusted craftsmen, who work in close collaboration with the
							troupes. In this way, the mask-maker imparts his own understanding
							of the character which eventually also shapes the dances.

							Performers use only the full-face masks, but smaller masks are
							also produced and sold to the art collectors. The performance
							masks are full-face, and covers almost the parietal bone to the
							base of the back skull which allows for an improved stability
							especially when halos strung of wire are added around the
							headgear. The wire frames on the headgear are embellished using
							coloured beads, sequins, confetti, etc., to evoke the image of the
							imposing gods and goddesses, grotesque demons, or specific animals
							which the masks portray.

							Chhau masks are made by artists from the Sutradhar community. The
							making of a mask goes through various stages. 8-10 layers of soft
							paper, immersed in diluted glue, are pasted one after another on
							the mould before the mud mould is dusted with fine ash powder. The
							facial features are made of clay. A special layer of mud and cloth
							is applied and the mask is then sun-dried. After this, the mould
							is polished and a second round of sun drying is done before
							separating the layers of cloth and paper from the mould. After
							finishing and drilling of holes for the nose and eyes, the mask is
							coloured and decorated.

							The base of the mask is formed with a wood or a cane, which most
							mask makers own. After this, the clay is applied to the base and a
							mould is created. The mould, after it has been dried, is separated
							from the base and layered with papier mache. The papier mache is
							smoothened by adding another layer of clay. Lightweight cotton
							fabrics are also used at times. The making of the base requires
							roughly about three days, and most of this time is needed for
							sun-drying. However, before the entire mask dries up completely
							details such as hair, eyes, eyebrows, etc., are added. The
							decoration and painting of the masks requires another set of three
							working days or more. Smaller and simple masks, usually meant to
							be taken and sold as souvenirs, are painted and decorated within a
							day.

							The clay used for mask-making is sourced from alluvial soil from
							neighbouring farms, while hair and animal manes are made using
							jute or acrylic wool. Paint, wire, the sequins, shiny stars,
							leaves and other decorative items come from the wholesale markets
							of Kolkata in large quantities. Older masks being sold from the
							artisan's collection undergoes what is called polishing: that is
							the artists add colour to spruce them up. While blow dryers are
							used to hasten the drying phase so as to meet the clients'
							deadline. In Charida, the artists are not just skilled craftsmen
							but also very able sales people.

							Charida, located in the Baghmundi block of Purulia, is the centre
							of making Chhau masks, where nearly every residence along the
							street becomes a workshop simultaneously. Some even have names
							like Mukhosh Ghar (House of Masks). The place has been designated
							as the Bengal government's Department of Micro, Small and Medium
							Enterprises \& Textiles, in association with UNESCO. Charida is
							also known as Mukhosh Gram, literally meaning the mask village.
							<br />
							<hr class="blank" />
							In Charida, mask making is a family business. The place has 300
							individuals from 115 families approximately engaged in this art of
							mask creation. Simple ingredients like clay and paper is used,
							however the process is slow, detailed and progresses from one step
							to another. While for the final decorations tinsel, glass beads,
							zari , plastic flowers, feathers, strips of coloured jute for
							hair, etc. are used. Even little girls and boys are engaged in
							this creative process, and this is a way that the art is handed
							down from one generation to the next.
							<br />
							<hr class="blank" />
							The chief mask-maker supervises the task executed mainly by the
							women folk in the family. The distinctive decoration, which adds
							the vibrancy and elaborate effect for which the Purulia masks are
							known, is done almost entirely by the women of the household.
